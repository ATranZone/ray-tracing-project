# ray-tracing-project
Ray tracing project from my computer graphics course at UCR. Program is not fully implemented properly.
I learned a lot about object oriented programming and vector math from this project and was able to get a lot of hands on experience with C++. This was probably one of the hardest projects I worked on.

Expected Output:

My Output:
